                                If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw.

                                longsword would deal 3d8 slashing damage (instead of
                                ld8), or 3d10 slashing damage (instead of ldlO) when
                                used with two hands.
